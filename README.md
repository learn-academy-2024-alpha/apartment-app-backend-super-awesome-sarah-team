# Apartment App 4/9/2024

### Purpose

Decoupled React and Rails API application.

As a developer, I have been commissioned to create an application that lists apartments available for rent. As a visiting user of the application, I can see a list of all available apartments. I can click on an apartment listing and see more information about that apartment. If I want to list an apartment for rent, I can create an account and log into the application. If I am logged in, I can add a new apartment. As a logged in user, I can see a list of all my apartments with the ability to edit or delete my listings.

### App Setup

- rails new apartment-app-backend --api -d postgresql -T
- run the app with `rails s`

### User Auth
